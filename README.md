## üßê Why vite-plugin-macro

There are already many solutions that provide macro capabilities
for Javascript or Typescript projects.
And some of them are very mature, such as [babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros)
(it's awesome, and maybe you will be interested in it).

However, according to my personal experience, they are not suitable for people like me.

All my projects are in Typescript, but their support for
Typescript is usually [not so good](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/94).

In those solutions, macros cannot interact with each other,
such as [importing](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/48)
or [nesting](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/173).
And users cannot import macros [like normal functions](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/111).

Most of them are Babel plugins, so they may read something that
has been changed by other plugins but not updated yet (like [bindings](https://github.com/kentcdodds/import-all.macro/issues/7)),
and can't control its position in the transformation chain.
But the main pain point of being a Babel plugin in the modern dev flow may be that
Babel is just a transformer, knowing nothing about modules and dependencies, which means
they [cannot re-expand macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-preval/issues/19) when changes occurred in dependent external conditions.

üòé **vite-plugin-macro** is born with **Typescript**, **ES Module**, and **Vite** - **none of the above problems exist**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install -D vite-plugin-macro
# or
$ yarn add -D vite-plugin-macro
```

## üìÑ Documentation

The plugin provides some explanatory text for
each parameter of each function and each field of each type.
So you can obtain more detailed descriptions in IDE and the `index.d.ts` of the plugin.

<summary>üîß <b>Define Your First Macro</b></summary>

It's pretty easy to define a macro!

vite-plugin-macro provides a function called `defineMacro()`, which creates a macro builder for you.

```typescript
import { defineMacro } from 'vite-plugin-macro'

const helloMacro = defineMacro(`hello`)
  .withCustomType(`export type Message = string`)
  .withSignature(`(): void`)
  .withSignature(`(msg: Message): void`, `output hello message`)
  .withHandler((ctx, babel, helper) => {
    const { path, args } = ctx
    const { template, types } = babel

    let msg: string
    if (args.length === 0) msg = 'Rollup'
    else {
      const firstArg = args[0]
      if (!types.isStringLiteral(firstArg))
        throw new Error('please use literal string as message')
      msg = firstArg.value
    }

    path.replaceWith(template.statement.ast(`console.log("Hello, ${msg}")`))
  })
```

_The above example is **JUST** to show how to define multiple signatures.
The above scenario is more suitable for using optional parameters
rather than overloading. see [Do's and Don'ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html#use-optional-parameters)._

As the above example shows, you should give a name, at least one signature,
maybe with a comment, and a handler function to a macro.
The custom type is optional.

Once the plugin starts (in Vite/Rollup),
the name, signatures, comments, and custom types will be combined and rendered
into a type declaration file, aka a `.d.ts` file.
So it's essential to write them correctly to provide a friendly develop experience in Typescript.

Note that the handler receives three arguments: `ctx`, `babel`, and `helper`.

- `ctx` - the transformation context, including the [node path](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md#paths) of
  the call expression currently being processed, traversal states, argument nodes, and so on.
- `babel` - a collection of Babel tools, containing
  [@babel/types](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-types),
  [@babel/traverse](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-traverse),
  [@babel/parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser),
  [@babel/template](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-template).
- `helper` - some wrapper functions on Babel tools make writing macro handlers easier.

vite-plugin-macro regards macros as functions;
when processing a source file, it will traverse all import statements
to find the imported macros, then traverse all function calls,
and call macro handlers for those macros.

Though sometimes these lexical macros are cumbersome to write,
please don't forget to remove or replace the call expressions like `ctx.path.replaceWith()`
or `ctx.path.remove()`, otherwise the plugin will process this call expression
again and again because there is always a macro call remaining in the source
until it reached the maximum recursion.
